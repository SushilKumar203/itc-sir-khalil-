The #system unit is the case that holds the computer's critical components.

A(n) #workstation is a specialized, single-user computer that typically has more power than a standard PC.

When not in use, a(n) #notebook computer folds up for easy storage.

A tablet PC lets you use a(n) #digital pen to tap or write directly on the screen.

A popular type of handheld computer is the #personal digital assistant (PDA).

A(n) #network server is usually a powerful personal computer that functions as the primary computer in a network.

In a traditional mainframe environment, each user accesses the mainframe through a device called a(n) #terminal.

A terminal is an example of a(n) #input/output (I/O) device.

The capabilities of a(n) #minicomputer are somewhere between mainframes and personal computers.

#Supercomputers are the most powerful computers made.


1-What is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes data, performs calculations, and executes instructions to provide output or store information. It can process various types of data, such as text, images, and audio.

2-Explain a few of the different ways in which computers can be categorized.
Computers can be categorized by their size (e.g., mainframe, minicomputer, microcomputer), purpose (e.g., general-purpose, specialized), and user capacity (e.g., single-user, multi-user).

3-List six types of computers that are designed for use by a single person.
Six types of single-user computers are desktop computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet PCs, handheld computers, and workstations.

4-Describe the two common designs for desktop computers.
Desktop computers typically come in tower and all-in-one designs. Towers house the main components separately from the monitor, while all-in-one designs integrate the monitor and system unit.

5-How much do notebook computers typically weigh?
Notebook computers generally weigh between 2 to 7 pounds, making them portable and convenient for mobile use.

6-List four types of computers that are designed for use by organizations, and are commonly used by multiple people at the same time.
Four types are mainframes, minicomputers, servers, and supercomputers. These are typically used in large organizations to handle extensive processing tasks and support multiple users.

7-Why are mainframe systems usually limited in the number of tasks they perform?
Mainframe systems are often optimized for specific, high-volume tasks (like transaction processing) rather than general-purpose computing, allowing them to perform these tasks efficiently and reliably.

8-What is the most popular use for home computers?
The most popular uses for home computers include personal productivity, internet browsing, gaming, and media consumption.

9-How are computer technologies used by the military?
In the military, computers are used for communication, simulation and training, weapon systems control, and intelligence gathering.

10-How are computer technologies being used to train surgeons?
Computers are used to train surgeons through simulations and virtual reality systems, allowing them to practice procedures in a risk-free environment and improve their skills.
